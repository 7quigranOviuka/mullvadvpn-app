The film begins with Mira (Karin Trentephol), a 12-year-old girl who lives with her mother Irene (Lisa Gastoni) and her stepfather Carlo (Mel Ferrer), a wealthy and paralyzed businessman. Mira is bored and lonely, spending most of her time wandering in the woods near their villa. One day, she finds an injured man named Federico (Howard Ross), who has been shot by the police for being a notorious child murderer. Mira feels sorry for him and decides to hide him in an abandoned shack, bringing him food and medicine. She also develops a strange fascination and attraction for him, despite knowing his crimes.
 
Meanwhile, Irene is unhappy with her marriage to Carlo, who treats her coldly and neglects her sexually. She is also frustrated by Mira's rebellious and distant attitude. When she discovers Mira's secret, she follows her to the shack and meets Federico. She is instantly drawn to him and seduces him, offering him money and protection in exchange for his love. Federico agrees, but he also continues to see Mira, who becomes jealous of her mother's affair. The situation becomes more complicated when Carlo becomes suspicious of Irene's behavior and hires a private detective to follow her.
