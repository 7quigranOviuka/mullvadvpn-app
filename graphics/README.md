# Graphic assets

This folder contains graphic assets that are used to generate assets for either the app or platforms
where the app is distributed.

## Android

The `Android-feature-graphics.psd` file should be used to generate a PNG image to be used as the
feature graphics in the app's Google Play Store listing. The PNG image should be placed in the
`android/src/main/play/listings/en-US/graphics/feature-graphics/` directory.
